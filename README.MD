## Description

Bankist App is a fictional banking application that is made with HTML, CSS & JS. So the Bankist app emulates the functions of a banking application where you can view your balance, apply for a loan, transfer money and close an account, you can also view money in and money out and also you are also able to view your interest accrued, there is also a sort feature where you can sort your transactions in descending order. There is also a timer at the bottom of the page that after 5 minutes of inactivity logs the user out.

## How To Interact with the Application
* The site is located at the url https://williz4.github.io/Bankist-App/

* So bascially there are two accounts that are hard coded into the application.
* First account to enable login is js as the username and 1111 as the pin. The second account is jd and the pin is 2222
* Once logged in the user can view fictional transactions in the application, sort them out and be able to transfer money to the other user, request a loan and also close an account.
* To be able to transfer money say when you are logged in as js in the transfer to field input the name jd and the amount you want to transfer and viceversa if you are logged in as jd and want to transfer money to js
